# NP Developer

If you want to develop software for the NP, you are going to need the following tools:

1. Raspberry Pi 4 **board** 4go or more
2. Power supply : **3A/5V USB-C (Board) + 2A/5V (LED Matrice)**
3. LED Matrice 32x16 **Adafruit**
4. Sdcard **8 go or more**
5. Webcam **USB**
6. Relay **5V**

### **Rapsberry PI 4 with Linux development**

If you want to be running the same distribution as I did when I developed, I suggest you have a look at my [**Raspberry Debian 10**](https://github.com/Layapanda/Projet_NP/tree/main/doc/RaspberryDebian) image creation procedure for the **Raspberry PI 4 board**.

Refer to the sections only talking about deploying the system for the NP.

### **Developing additionnal software for the NP**

You have a full access to the design and specification of the system + the source code associated with it.

Here a few links for the documents that will interest you:
1. [Specifications](../Specs_and_Design/CDS_NP_MARTINEZ_Pablo.pdf) : where you'll find a general system architecture diagram and design choices
2. [Design Reference](../Specs_and_Design/CA_NP_MARTINEZ_Pablo.pdf) : a document telling you how every component is structured and how you should use it
3. [Wiring diagram](../Specs_and_Design/Wiring_NP.pdf) : This is the current system wiring diagram for the peripherals
4. [Project_report](../Specs_and_Design/Rapport_NP_MARTINEZ_Pablo.pdf) : This is the final report of the NP_project

The full system source code is stored inside [**the folder**](https://github.com/Layapanda/Projet_NP/).
You'll have everyfind regarding all of the services installed on the board to control the peripherals.


*If you follow the above stated guides, you should be able to work with this system with any issues.*
